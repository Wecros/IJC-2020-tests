TESTING TAIL

Go into `cd tests` and run `./testtail.sh [path_to_your_tail_program]`.

To test everything, copy the `tests/` folder into your IJC-project-2 directory. Go into `cd tests` and run `./testall.sh`. You need to have binary executables of `tail`, `wordcount-`, `wordcount`, `wordcount-dynamic` for test to work properly.
